Venanzio Rauzzini had quite a fascinating life. Early on in his musical education, he sang in the choir of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. Later, he was a pupil of voice teacher Domenico Corri and the great pianist Muzio Clementi; Rauzzini thus developed not only into a master singer, but also a virtuoso pianist. Rauzzini supposedly owed his beautiful voice to the fact that he was a castrato, yet it was rumored that it was simply because of some sort of developmental problem; this would have explained why, despite being a “castrato”, Rauzzini had quite a few love affairs. His success was so great that he “lived like a prince”, according to Charles Burney. In fact, Mozart himself composed the work “Exsultate, Jubilate” for Rauzzini in 1773; the immortal Austrian master was extremely impressed by the Italian’s exceptional vocal skills. Rauzzini settled in England (Bath) in 1780. Haydn met him when he visited England in 1794, and was well-disposed towards him, as evidenced by the fact that he composed a little piece meant to be placed on the headstone of Rauzzini’s dog! Rauzzini was a conductor as well, and loved to conduct the orchestra when his own operas were performed. He also created music for keyboard (much of which can also be accompanied by violin). The present sonata is the first of a set of three published in 1786; they are  composed for “harpsichord or piano”
