Another source is a French vaudeville play, Le r\u00e9veillon, by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy. This was first translated by Carl Haffner into a non-musical play to be produced in Vienna. However, the peculiarly French custom of the r\u00e9veillon (a midnight supper party) caused problems, which were solved by the decision to adapt the play as a libretto for Johann Strauss, with the r\u00e9veillon replaced by a Viennese ball. At this point Haffner's translation was handed over for adaptation to Richard Gen\u00e9e, who subsequently claimed not only that he had made a fresh translation from scratch but that he had never even met Haffner.\n\nThe operetta premi\u00e8red on April 5, 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, Austria and has been part of the regular operetta repertoire ever since. It currently appears as number 19 on Opera America's list of the 20 most-performed operatic works in North America.",

        "description": "\"Shooting Stars\". For the Hernals church festival of the year 1860, celebrated with a festive concert and a ball on 27th August in Franz Unger\u2019s casino, Josef Strauss wrote a waltz entitled Sternschnuppen. The work had its basis in fact, as during the summer of 1860 many meteorite showers were seen over Vienna. The work and its performance were advertised on 24th August 1860 in the Fremden-Blatt. Even though no report about this festival has been found until now in the press, there is no doubt that these musical Shooting Stars were admired on this evening in Hernals. The premi\u00e8re of this waltz has been recorded in the notes of both Josef and Franz Sabay. In the novelty concert held by Josef Strauss on 31st August 1860 in the Volksgarten, the waltz was repeated, as well as in the final concert in Unger\u2019s casino on 7th October, in the programme of which, as a counterpart to the Carnival revue, all the summer compositions by Josef Strauss were also included. The waltz Sternschnuppen seems to have been a great success, because on the occasion of its appearance in print by the publisher Carl Haslinger, the trade paper Zwischen-Akt wrote on 3rd February 1861: \"Josef Strauss\u2019 popular waltz Sternschnuppen has just been published in an elegant edition. These fresh melodies were very well received at the end of the Carnival.\"\n\nDon't forget to subscribe and leave a comment, that would be helpful to improve my channel. Thank you!\n\nDailymotion Channel: http://www.dailymotion.com/ziehrereien478\n\nEspa\u00f1ol:\n\n\"Estrellas fugaces\". Para la fiesta de la iglesia de Hernals del a\u00f1o 1860, celebrada con un concierto festivo y un baile el 27 de agosto en el casino de Franz Unger, Josef Strauss escribi\u00f3 un vals titulado Sternschnuppen. El trabajo tuvo su base de hecho, ya que durante el verano de 1860 se vieron muchas lluvias de meteoritos sobre Viena. La obra y su interpretaci\u00f3n se anunciaron el 24 de agosto de 1860 en el Fremden-Blatt. A pesar de que hasta ahora no se ha encontrado ning\u00fan informe sobre este festival en la prensa, no hay duda de que estas esstrellas fugaces musicales Stars fueron admiradas esa velada en Hernals. El estreno de este vals se ha registrado en las notas de Josef y Franz Sabay. En el concierto de novedad celebrado por Josef Strauss el 31 de agosto de 1860 en el Volksgarten, se repiti\u00f3 el vals, as\u00ed como en el concierto final en el casino de Unger el 7 de octubre, en cuyo programa, como contrapartida de la revista Carnival, todos Tambi\u00e9n se incluyeron las composiciones veraniegas de Josef Strauss. El vals Sternschnuppen parece haber tenido un gran \u00e9xito, porque con motivo de su aparici\u00f3n impresa por el editor Carl Haslinger, el peri\u00f3dico comercial Zwischen-Akt escribi\u00f3 el 3 de febrero de 1861: \"El popular vals Sternschnuppen de Josef Strauss acaba de ser publicado en una edici\u00f3n elegante. Estas frescas melod\u00edas fueron muy bien recibidas al final del Carnaval \u201d.\n\nNo olviden suscribirse, compartir y dejar un comentario, eso seria de gran ayuda para mejorar mi canal.

        "description": "A thrilling account of Schubert\u2019s colossal (and ingenious) Wanderer Fantasy. The Wanderer Fantasy is at once a fantasy built around an implied variation form, a one-movement sonata, and a traditional four-movement sonata. This is all possible because every single movement is built around the same motif, which is itself derived from the opening phrase of Schubert\u2019s lied Der Wanderer (this opening phrase is quoted nearly exactly in the opening of the second movement.) Note also how Schubert integrates organic transitions between movements into the work: the opening of Mvt 3 is directly derived from the LH figuration at the end of Mvt 2, for instance. As the work progresses from movement to movement without pause, we hear the Wanderer motif being constantly transformed; in the first movement it is used as the subject of a sonata form (both themes in this movement are similar enough that calling it monothematic is quite fair); in the second as the base of a set of variations; in the third as part of a magnificent scherzo in compound time, and in the fourth as the basis of a fugue which builds to a truly thunderous finale.  The Wanderer Fantasy represents the first truly structural use of the device of thematic transformation, which Liszt exploited to its fullest in his great B Minor Sonata \u2013 it is no coincidence that Liszt was highly familiar with the Wanderer Fantasy, as his transcriptions of it attest. \n\nLewis\u2019 performance of the Wanderer Fantasy demonstrates that Schubert was a fantastic colorist and dramatist in the full-blooded Beethovenian mould; he is more willing than most to allow Schubert\u2019s music to expand into the vast sounds it requires. The first movement opens with propulsive energy, but quickly broadens into fine deltas of light and shade. The second features some remarkably subtle pianissimo playing [see the passage beginning at 10:58] shot through with almost unbearable restlessness [see the beautiful buildup beginning at 7:50]. The third bounds along until Lewis suddenly arrests all movement with a dreamlike trio; and the fourth builds up ferociously with ironclad clarity into a climax of blinding ecstasy [see the sheer sweep of 18:37, and so on]. \n\n00:00 \u2013 Mvt 1, Allegro con fuoco ma non troppo\n05:42 \u2013 Mvt 2, Adagio\n12:14 \u2013 Mvt 3, Presto\n16:59 \u2013 Mvt 4, Allegro",

        "description": "Chopin\u2019s second piano concerto is more conventional than his first. The opening Maestoso movement of the piece is modeled on the concertos of Mozart's pupil, Hummel. The central Larghetto is similarly inspired by the Piano Concerto in G minor composed in 1820 by Ignaz Moscheles, but the closing Allegro vivace is original, a stylized Polish folk song. Within the movements, all the standard concerto principles are obeyed: an orchestra exposition of the main themes before a piano exposition of the same material, the usual contrast between the tonic minor and the relative major for the principal and subordinate themes, a lyrical slow movement in the relative minor, and a rondo-form finale in the tonic major. Despite its conventional structure, Chopin's piano writing is idiomatic and highly personal \u2013 the lyrical melodies and their ornamentations could have been composed by no one else. Chopin\u2019s piano concertos are often criticized for orchestral writing that is at best competent. This, however, is less a fault than a decision: Chopin, the greatest composer for the piano of his age, would never let anything obscure the brilliance of his piano writing.\n\nThe second piano concerto was actually written before the first, but was designated \u201cNo. 2\u201d  as it was published second.\n\n0:00 - Maestoso\n15:37 - Larghetto\n26:42 - Allegro vivace\n\nPerformed with the Polish Festival Orchestra, conducted by Zimerman",

        "description": "Edvard Hagerup Grieg (15 June 1843 \u2013 4 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist. He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to international consciousness, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius and Bed\u0159ich Smetana did in Finland and Bohemia, respectively.\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nPiano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16 (1868)\n\n1. Allegro molto moderato (0:00)\n2. Adagio (12:51)\n3. Allegro moderato molto e marcato (19:00)\n\nLeif Ove Andsnes, piano and Bergen Philharmonic conducted by Ole Christian Ruud\nWatch live performance here: https://youtu.be/liFdIN2vUr4\n\nThe work is among Grieg's earliest important works, written by the 24-year-old composer in 1868 in S\u00f8ller\u00f8d, Denmark, during one of his visits there to benefit from the climate.\n\nThe concerto is often compared to the Piano Concerto of Robert Schumann: it is in the same key; the opening descending flourish on the piano is similar; the overall style is considered to be closer to Schumann than any other single composer. Incidentally, both composers wrote only one concerto for piano. Grieg had heard Schumann's concerto played by Clara Schumann in Leipzig in 1858, and was greatly influenced by Schumann's style generally, having been taught the piano by Schumann's friend Ernst Ferdinand Wenzel.\n\nGrieg's concerto provides evidence of his interest in Norwegian folk music; the opening flourish is based on the motif of a falling minor second followed by a falling major third, which is typical of the folk music of Grieg's native country. This specific motif occurs in other works by Grieg, including the String Quartet No. 1. In the last movement of the concerto, similarities to the halling (a Norwegian folk dance) and imitations of the Hardanger fiddle (the Norwegian folk fiddle) have been detected.\n\nThe work was premiered by Edmund Neupert on April 3, 1869, in Copenhagen, with Holger Simon Paulli conducting. Some sources say that Grieg himself, an excellent pianist, was the intended soloist, but he was unable to attend the premiere owing to commitments with an orchestra in Christiania (now Oslo). Among those who did attend the premiere were the Danish composer Niels Gade and the Russian pianist Anton Rubinstein, who provided his piano for the occasion. Neupert was also the dedicatee of the second edition of the concerto (Rikard Nordraak was the original dedicatee), and James Huneker said that he composed the first movement cadenza.\n\nThe Norwegian premiere in Christiania followed on August 7, 1869, and the piece was later heard in Germany in 1872 and England in 1874. At Grieg's visit to Franz Liszt in Rome in 1870, Liszt played the notes a prima vista (by sight) before an audience of musicians and gave very good comments on Grieg's work which would later influence him. The work was first published in Leipzig in 1872, but only after Johan Svendsen intervened on Grieg's behalf.\n\nThe concerto is the first piano concerto ever recorded\u2014by pianist Wilhelm Backhaus in 1909.[9] Due to the technology of the time, it was heavily abridged and ran only six minutes.\n\nGrieg revised the work at least seven times, usually in subtle ways, but the revisions amounted to over 300 differences from the original orchestration. In one of these revisions, he undid Liszt's suggestion to give the second theme of the first movement (as well as the first theme of the second) to the trumpet rather than to the cello. The final version of the concerto was completed only a few weeks before Grieg's death, and it is this version that has achieved worldwide popularity. The original 1868 version has been recorded, by Love Derwinger, with the Norrk\u00f6ping Symphony Orchestra under Junichi Hirokami.",

He received his musical education at the minorite monastery of Maihingen, at the Benedictine abbey of Neresheim and at the Jesuit school in Augsburg in 1777. In 1778 he entered the Benedictine abbey of Donauw\u00f6rth; he took vows in 1779, adopting the monastic name of Gregor, and was ordained priest on 5 June 1784. After obtaining permission to live outside the community in 1794, he became Kapellmeister and composer at the Palazzo Menz in Bolzano, and in 1798 at the latest assistant organist at the parish and collegiate church there. From 1801 to 1822 he was Kapellmeister of Augsburg Cathedral. As a composer B\u00fchler was influenced especially by J.M. Demmler and Antonio Rosetti. Settings of the mass are at the heart of his extensive output, which ranges from simple hymns to the monumental Passion oratorio Jesus, der g\u00f6ttliche Erl\u00f6ser and includes over 100 publications; careful instrumentation, attention to the interpretation of words and distinct early Romantic tendencies are notable features of his music. After the secularization of 1802-03, B\u00fchler composed sacred works (mostly published by Lotter and B\u00f6hm of Augsburg) suitable for simple circumstances. Interest in his sacred music was aroused in America and England when a transcription of a Mass in F was published by the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston in 1832. Between 1840 and 1876 other arrangements and vocal scores were published in London, Paris and Cincinnati, and were distributed in Boston, New York and Mexico. B\u00fchler also wrote several pedagogical and theoretical works.",
